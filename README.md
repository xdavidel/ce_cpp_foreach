#C++ Exercise: For each

Some languages allow you to perform an operation on all the elements of a
collection in an elegant way. In C#, for example, it’s being done using a for
each operator, and in Java and C++11 there’s a special for (item :
collection) syntax. Let’s write our own, C++98 version.
1. Create a generic forEach() function. It will receive and array, its size,
and an action that should be carried out on each element of the
array.
2. Use this function to print all elements in an int array.
3. Use this function to sum up the values in a double array.
